### Project Description
FLAMES ‚Äî The Ultimate Relationship Destiny Predictor üî•üíò

Why waste years of your life figuring out where your ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù is headed when FLAMES can decide in seconds?
Using cutting-edge pseudo-randomness and the ancient playground algorithm passed down through generations of bored middle-schoolers, FLAMES calculates your true fate ‚Äî Friend, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, or Siblings.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are struggling with uncertainty in their relationships. Therapy? Honest conversations? Nah. What you really need is a completely unscientific, 100% emotionally chaotic tool to make all your life decisions for you.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built FLAMES:

Input your names.

Press a button.

Let the algorithm of destiny (and maybe a random number generator) reveal your relationship status.

Laugh, cry, or immediately block the other person ‚Äî based purely on the result.

With fancy animations, random percentages, and floating paper planes that symbolize‚Ä¶ something (probably love? maybe air pollution?), FLAMES is the most useless yet emotionally damaging app you‚Äôll ever use.
